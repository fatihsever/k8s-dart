**path** | **String** | Path is matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \"path\" part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a '/' and must be present when using PathType with value \"Exact\" or \"Prefix\". | [optional] 
**pathType** | **String** | PathType determines the interpretation of the Path matching. PathType can be one of the following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is   done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the   list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a   match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the   request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring   of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar   matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz). * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to   the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType   or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types. Implementations are required to support all path types. |
